# ROADMAP.md

> **Current Milestone**: v3.0 - Industrial Premium Polish ("The Juice")
> **Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Not Started)

## Milestone Goal
Transform the site from a "Glade-inspired template" into a **Bespoke Industrial Experience** that feels like a proprietary engineering dashboard, not a marketing landing page.

## Must-Haves
- [ ] **Motion/Juice**: GSAP or Framer Motion scroll-triggered animations, micro-interactions on all interactive elements.
- [ ] **Broken Grid Layout**: Asymmetric compositions, full-bleed imagery, overflow elements.
- [ ] **Technical Brutalism**: HUD aesthetic with data-dense UI, monospaced labels, vector flourishes.
- [ ] **Texture & Depth**: Glassmorphism, film grain/noise overlay, backdrop blur effects.

## Nice-to-Haves
- [ ] Parallax background layers for depth.
- [ ] Sequential "assembly" animations for hardware renders.
- [ ] Coordinate crosshairs and technical ornaments.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Motion & Micro-Interactions ("The Juice")
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Make the site feel alive with scroll-triggered animations and hover effects.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement GSAP ScrollTrigger or enhance Framer Motion usage.
- [ ] Add sequential reveal animations (stagger, cascade).
- [ ] Add micro-interactions: hover scale, "scan" light effects on modules.
- [ ] Implement parallax layers on blueprint/hero backgrounds.

---

### Phase 2: Breaking the Grid (Asymmetric Layouts)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Break out of the 12-column template feel.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement full-bleed hero images/sections.
- [ ] Create overlapping elements (images bleeding into adjacent sections).
- [ ] Use z-index layering for 3D "pop" effect on hardware renders.
- [ ] Asymmetric text/image compositions.

---

### Phase 3: Technical Brutalism Aesthetic
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Add visual density with HUD-style elements.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Add monospaced labels/data points (e.g., `MODEL_REF: RP-400`).
- [ ] Implement corner brackets, coordinate crosshairs on containers.
- [ ] Create "vector flourish" line-work connecting modules.
- [ ] Add subtle blueprint grid overlays where appropriate.

---

### Phase 4: Texture & Materiality
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Kill the "shiny plastic" feel with real texture.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Enhance glassmorphism on info-cards (backdrop-filter blur).
- [ ] Add subtle film grain/noise texture overlay to site.
- [ ] Implement soft shadows and layered depth.
- [ ] Review and refine color palette for "industrial premium" feel.

---

### Phase 5: Final Polish & Verification
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Quality assurance and performance validation.
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness audit.
- [ ] Performance optimization (ensure animations don't tank CWV).
- [ ] Final visual review against "Bespoke Industrial Experience" goal.
